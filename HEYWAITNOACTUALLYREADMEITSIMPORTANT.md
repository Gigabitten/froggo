VERY IMPORTANT:
MAKE SURE TO REPLACE THE WORD 'TOKEN' IN THE LAST LINE WITH YOUR DISCORD BOT'S TOKEN.
DO NOT PUSH A VERSION OF INDEX.JS WITH THIS TOKEN INCLUDED.
IF YOU COMMIT INDEX.JS, DO `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
IT COMPLETELY UNDOES A COMMIT. UNDO AS MANY AS NEEDED BEFORE PUSHING.

Dependencies:
- node, obviously
- discord.js (npm i discord.js)

also you probably want nodemon but it's definitely not required
oh, I just got the pun in nodemon's name. Nice.

A handful of code taken from discord.js.org's example on their front page. It's hardly any.
